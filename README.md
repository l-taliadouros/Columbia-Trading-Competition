# Columbia-Trading-Competition

This is the repo of my codes for my participation at the Columbia Trading Competition, where I was among the top10 that received prizes (9th). This repo only includes part of my strategy, as my decisions were also based on my observation of other player's behavior. The flyer of the competition is property of Columbia Alpha Partners.

A write up will follow.

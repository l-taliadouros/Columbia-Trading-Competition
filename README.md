# Columbia-Trading-Competition

This is the repo of my codes for my participation at the Columbia Trading Competition, where I was among the top10 that received prizes (9th). This repo only includes part of my strategy, as my decisions were also based on my observation of other player's behavior.

A write up will follow.
